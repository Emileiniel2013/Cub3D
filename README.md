# Cube3D
Project about creating a Wolfenstein 3D like game using raycasting.
A small project where I built a simple 3D engine using raycasting, similar to the old-school Wolfenstein 3D. The goal was to render a pseudo-3D environment based on a 2D map, and implement basic movement and collision. Everything is written in C, using MiniLibX for window and image handling.

The player can walk around, rotate the view, and the walls are drawn using the DDA algorithm. It’s all based on casting one ray per vertical stripe of the screen and figuring out where it hits a wall.
